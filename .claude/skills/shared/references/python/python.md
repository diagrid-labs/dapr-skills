# Dapr Workflow Python SDK Reference

## Overview

Dapr Workflow for Python is provided by the `dapr-ext-workflow` package, which is part of the `dapr` Python SDK
extensions. Workflows are plain Python generator functions decorated with `@wfr.workflow`. Activities are plain Python
functions decorated with `@wfr.activity`. The `WorkflowRuntime` manages worker startup, and `DaprWorkflowClient`
handles scheduling and lifecycle management.

There is no sandbox: **you** are responsible for writing deterministic workflow code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install dapr dapr-ext-workflow
```

Requires Python 3.9+.

## Workflow Definition

A workflow is a Python generator function that `yield`s activity/child-workflow calls. The function receives a
`DaprWorkflowContext` and an optional input value.

```python
# runtime.py
from dapr.ext.workflow import WorkflowRuntime

wfr = WorkflowRuntime()
```

```python
# workflow.py
from dapr.ext.workflow import DaprWorkflowContext
from runtime import wfr
from activities import say_hello

@wfr.workflow(name='greeting_workflow')
def greeting_workflow(ctx: DaprWorkflowContext, name: str):
    greeting = yield ctx.call_activity(say_hello, input=name)
    return greeting
```

## Activity Definition

An activity is a plain Python function decorated with `@wfr.activity`. It receives a `WorkflowActivityContext` and
an optional input value. Activities can call external services, databases, and other I/O-bound operations.

```python
# activities.py
from dapr.ext.workflow import WorkflowActivityContext
from runtime import wfr

@wfr.activity(name='say_hello')
def say_hello(ctx: WorkflowActivityContext, name: str) -> str:
    return f'Hello, {name}!'
```

## App Setup and Registration

Register workflows and activities by decorating them with the `WorkflowRuntime` instance. Start the runtime before
scheduling workflows; shut it down on exit.

```python
# app.py
from time import sleep
from dapr.ext.workflow import DaprWorkflowClient

from runtime import wfr
from workflow import greeting_workflow

def main():
    wfr.start()
    sleep(2)  # Wait for the sidecar to become available

    wf_client = DaprWorkflowClient()

    instance_id = wf_client.schedule_new_workflow(
        workflow=greeting_workflow,
        input='world',
    )
    print(f'Started workflow instance: {instance_id}')

    state = wf_client.wait_for_workflow_completion(
        instance_id=instance_id,
        timeout_in_seconds=30,
    )
    print(f'Workflow result: {state.serialized_output}')

    wfr.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Run with Dapr

```bash
dapr run --app-id myapp --dapr-grpc-port 50001 -- python app.py
```

## Key Concepts

### Workflow Definition
- Decorate with `@wfr.workflow(name='...')` — the `name` is the workflow type name used for scheduling
- The function must be a Python generator (use `yield` to call activities or child workflows)
- Return value becomes the workflow output
- Use `ctx.instance_id` to get the current workflow instance ID
- Use `ctx.is_replaying` to suppress logging during replay (avoid duplicate log lines)
- Use `ctx.current_utc_datetime` for the current time (replay-safe)

### Activity Definition
- Decorate with `@wfr.activity(name='...')`
- Regular Python functions — no `yield`, no generator protocol
- Can call Dapr APIs using `DaprClient`
- `ctx.task_id` returns the activity task ID

### Runtime Setup
- Create a single `WorkflowRuntime()` instance in `runtime.py`
- Import `wfr` from `runtime.py` in both `workflow.py` and `activities.py`
- Call `wfr.start()` before scheduling workflows
- Call `wfr.shutdown()` on exit
- Decorators auto-register workflows and activities with the runtime

### File Organization Best Practice

Keep the runtime instance, workflow logic, and activity logic in separate files to avoid circular imports:

```
my_dapr_app/
├── runtime.py        # WorkflowRuntime instance (wfr)
├── workflow.py       # Workflow definitions (imports wfr from runtime)
├── activities.py     # Activity definitions (imports wfr from runtime)
├── main.py           # Entry point: runtime start, client, scheduling
└── models.py         # Shared Pydantic models
```

The `runtime.py` file breaks the circular dependency between `workflow.py` and `activities.py`.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Non-deterministic code in workflows** — use `ctx.current_utc_datetime` for time; delegate I/O to activities
2. **Calling `time.sleep()` in workflows** — use `ctx.create_timer(timedelta(...))` instead
3. **Mutating global state in workflows** — replay will re-run the code; side effects must be idempotent
4. **Not waiting for the sidecar** — add a short `sleep` or retry loop before calling the workflow client
5. **Using `print()` unsafely in workflows** — guard with `if not ctx.is_replaying:` to avoid duplicate output
6. **Missing `yield`** — forgetting `yield ctx.call_activity(...)` means the activity call is never awaited
